🎬 I’m Raiyan, a creative video editor with 2 years of experience and certifications from FSD Academy and GP Youth Skills. I specialize in transforming all kinds of footage into eye-catching, professional edits using 🎞️ Premiere Pro, ✨ After Effects, 🎥 Filmora, and 📱 CapCut.

✨ What sets me apart is my ability to blend storytelling with style. Whether it’s a 🎬 cinematic film sequence, 🎮 a fast-paced gaming montage, 💫 an emotional anime-inspired edit, or 📢 polished brand content, I approach each project with creativity, precision, and a fresh perspective.

🔥 I believe editing is more than just cutting clips—it’s about creating an experience. Inspired by 🎞️ films, 🎮 gaming, and 🌀 anime, I bring unique visual energy and narrative flow to every project I work on. My goal is simple: to make your content stand out, connect with your audience, and feel unforgettable.
